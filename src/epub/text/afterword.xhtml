			<h2 epub:type="title">A Backward Glance O’er Travel’d Roads</h2>
			<p>Perhaps the best of songs heard, or of any and all true love, or life’s fairest episodes, or sailors’, soldiers’ trying scenes on land or sea, is the résumé of them, or any of them, long afterwards, looking at the actualities away back past, with all their practical excitations gone. How the soul loves to float amid such reminiscences!</p>
			<p>So here I sit gossiping in the early candlelight of old age⁠—I and my book⁠—casting backward glances over our travel’d road. After completing, as it were, the journey⁠—(a varied jaunt of years, with many halts and gaps of intervals⁠—or some lengthen’d ship-voyage, wherein more than once the last hour had apparently arrived, and we seem’d certainly going down⁠—yet reaching port in a sufficient way through all discomfitures at last)⁠—After completing my poems, I am curious to review them in the light of their own (at the time unconscious, or mostly unconscious) intentions, with certain unfoldings of the thirty years they seek to embody. These lines, therefore, will probably blend the weft of first purposes and speculations, with the warp of that experience afterwards, always bringing strange developments.</p>
			<p>Result of seven or eight stages and struggles extending through nearly thirty years, (as I nigh my threescore-and-ten I live largely on memory,) I look upon <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, now finish’d to the end of its opportunities and powers, as my definitive <i xml:lang="fr">carte visite</i> to the coming generations of the New World,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> if I may assume to say so. That I have not gain’d the acceptance of my own time, but have fallen back on fond dreams of the future⁠—anticipations⁠—(“still lives the song, though Regnar dies”)⁠—That from a worldly and business point of view <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> has been worse than a failure⁠—that public criticism on the book and myself as author of it yet shows mark’d anger and contempt more than anything else⁠—(“I find a solid line of enemies to you everywhere,”⁠—letter from <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W. S. K.</abbr>, Boston, May 28, 1884)⁠—And that solely for publishing it I have been the object of two or three pretty serious special official buffetings⁠—is all probably no more than I ought to have expected. I had my choice when I commenc’d. I bid neither for soft eulogies, big money returns, nor the approbation of existing schools and conventions. As fulfill’d or partially fulfill’d, the best comfort of the whole business (after a small band of the dearest friends and upholders ever vouchsafed to man or cause⁠—doubtless all the more faithful and uncompromising⁠—this little phalanx!⁠—for being so few) is that, unstopp’d and unwarp’d by any influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and put it unerringly on record⁠—the value thereof to be decided by time.</p>
			<p>In calculating that decision, William O’Connor and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Bucke are far more peremptory than I am. Behind all else that can be said, I consider <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> and its theory experimental⁠—as, in the deepest sense, I consider our American republic itself to be, with its theory. (I think I have at least enough philosophy not to be too absolutely certain of anything, or any results.) In the second place, the volume is a sortie⁠—whether to prove triumphant, and conquer its field of aim and escape and construction, nothing less than a hundred years from now can fully answer. I consider the point that I have positively gain’d a hearing, to far more than make up for any and all other lacks and withholdings. Essentially, <em>that</em> was from the first, and has remain’d throughout, the main object. Now it seems to be achiev’d, I am certainly contented to waive any otherwise momentous drawbacks, as of little account. Candidly and dispassionately reviewing all my intentions, I feel that they were creditable⁠—and I accept the result, whatever it may be.</p>
			<p>After continued personal ambition and effort, as a young fellow, to enter with the rest into competition for the usual rewards, business, political, literary, <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—to take part in the great melee, both for victory’s prize itself and to do some good⁠—After years of those aims and pursuits, I found myself remaining possess’d, at the age of thirty-one to thirty-three, with a special desire and conviction. Or rather, to be quite exact, a desire that had been flitting through my previous life, or hovering on the flanks, mostly indefinite hitherto, had steadily advanced to the front, defined itself, and finally dominated everything else. This was a feeling or ambition to articulate and faithfully express in literary or poetic form, and uncompromisingly, my own physical, emotional, moral, intellectual, and aesthetic Personality, in the midst of, and tallying, the momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days, and of current America⁠—and to exploit that Personality, identified with place and date, in a far more candid and comprehensive sense than any hitherto poem or book.</p>
			<p>Perhaps this is in brief, or suggests, all I have sought to do. Given the nineteenth century, with the United States, and what they furnish as area and points of view, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> is, or seeks to be, simply a faithful and doubtless self-will’d record. In the midst of all, it gives one man’s⁠—the author’s⁠—identity, ardors, observations, faiths, and thoughts, color’d hardly at all with any decided coloring from other faiths or other identities. Plenty of songs had been sung⁠—beautiful, matchless songs⁠—adjusted to other lands than these⁠—another spirit and stage of evolution; but I would sing, and leave out or put in, quite solely with reference to America and today. Modern science and democracy seem’d to be throwing out their challenge to poetry to put them in its statements in contradistinction to the songs and myths of the past. As I see it now (perhaps too late,) I have unwittingly taken up that challenge and made an attempt at such statements⁠—which I certainly would not assume to do now, knowing more clearly what it means.</p>
			<p>For grounds for <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, as a poem, I abandon’d the conventional themes, which do not appear in it: none of the stock ornamentation, or choice plots of love or war, or high, exceptional personages of Old-World song; nothing, as I may say, for beauty’s sake⁠—no legend, or myth, or romance, nor euphemism, nor rhyme. But the broadest average of humanity and its identities in the now ripening nineteenth century, and especially in each of their countless examples and practical occupations in the United States today.</p>
			<p>One main contrast of the ideas behind every page of my verses, compared with establish’d poems, is their different relative attitude towards God, towards the objective universe, and still more (by reflection, confession, assumption, <abbr>etc.</abbr>) the quite changed attitude of the ego, the one chanting or talking, towards himself and towards his fellow-humanity. It is certainly time for America, above all, to begin this readjustment in the scope and basic point of view of verse; for everything else has changed. As I write, I see in an article on Wordsworth, in one of the current English magazines, the lines, “A few weeks ago an eminent French critic said that, owing to the special tendency to science and to its all-devouring force, poetry would cease to be read in fifty years.” But I anticipate the very contrary. Only a firmer, vastly broader, new area begins to exist⁠—nay, is already form’d⁠—to which the poetic genius must emigrate. Whatever may have been the case in years gone by, the true use for the imaginative faculty of modern times is to give ultimate vivification to facts, to science, and to common lives, endowing them with the glows and glories and final illustriousness which belong to every real thing, and to real things only. Without that ultimate vivification⁠—which the poet or other artist alone can give⁠—reality would seem incomplete, and science, democracy, and life itself, finally in vain.</p>
			<p>Few appreciate the moral revolutions, our age, which have been profounder far than the material or inventive or war-produced ones. The nineteenth century, now well towards its close (and ripening into fruit the seeds of the two preceding centuries<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a>)⁠—the uprisings of national masses and shiftings of boundary-lines⁠—the historical and other prominent facts of the United States⁠—the war of attempted Secession⁠—the stormy rush and haste of nebulous forces⁠—never can future years witness more excitement and din of action⁠—never completer change of army front along the whole line, the whole civilized world. For all these new and evolutionary facts, meanings, purposes, new poetic messages, new forms and expressions, are inevitable.</p>
			<p>My Book and I⁠—what a period we have presumed to span! those thirty years from 1850 to ’80⁠—and America in them! Proud, proud indeed may we be, if we have cull’d enough of that period in its own spirit to worthily waft a few live breaths of it to the future!</p>
			<p>Let me not dare, here or anywhere, for my own purposes, or any purposes, to attempt the definition of Poetry, nor answer the question what it is. Like Religion, Love, Nature, while those terms are indispensable, and we all give a sufficiently accurate meaning to them, in my opinion no definition that has ever been made sufficiently encloses the name Poetry; nor can any rule or convention ever so absolutely obtain but some great exception may arise and disregard and overturn it.</p>
			<p>Also it must be carefully remember’d that first-class literature does not shine by any luminosity of its own; nor do its poems. They grow of circumstances, and are evolutionary. The actual living light is always curiously from elsewhere⁠—follows unaccountable sources, and is lunar and relative at the best. There are, I know, certain controlling themes that seem endlessly appropriated to the poets⁠—as war, in the past⁠—in the Bible, religious rapture and adoration⁠—always love, beauty, some fine plot, or pensive or other emotion. But, strange as it may sound at first, I will say there is something striking far deeper and towering far higher than those themes for the best elements of modern song.</p>
			<p>Just as all the old imaginative works rest, after their kind, on long trains of presuppositions, often entirely unmention’d by themselves, yet supplying the most important bases of them, and without which they could have had no reason for being, so <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, before a line was written, presupposed something different from any other, and, as it stands, is the result of such presupposition. I should say, indeed, it were useless to attempt reading the book without first carefully tallying that preparatory background and quality in the mind. Think of the United States today⁠—the facts of these thirty-eight or forty empires solder’d in one⁠—sixty or seventy millions of equals, with their lives, their passions, their future⁠—these incalculable, modern, American, seething multitudes around us, of which we are inseparable parts! Think, in comparison, of the petty environage and limited area of the poets of past or present Europe, no matter how great their genius. Think of the absence and ignorance in all cases hitherto, of the multitudinousness, vitality, and the unprecedented stimulants of today and here. It almost seems as if a poetry with cosmic and dynamic features of magnitude and limitlessness suitable to the human soul, were never possible before. It is certain that a poetry of absolute faith and equality for the use of the democratic masses never was.</p>
			<p>In estimating first-class song, a sufficient Nationality, or, on the other hand, what may be call’d the negative and lack of it, (as in Goethe’s case, it sometimes seems to me,) is often, if not always, the first element. One needs only a little penetration to see, at more or less removes, the material facts of their country and radius, with the coloring of the moods of humanity at the time, and its gloomy or hopeful prospects, behind all poets and each poet, and forming their birthmarks. I know very well that my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves</i> could not possibly have emerged or been fashion’d or completed, from any other era than the latter half of the nineteenth century, nor any other land than democratic America, and from the absolute triumph of the National Union arms.</p>
			<p>And whether my friends claim it for me or not, I know well enough, too, that in respect to pictorial talent, dramatic situations, and especially in verbal melody and all the conventional technique of poetry, not only the divine works that today stand ahead in the world’s reading, but dozens more, transcend (some of them immeasurably transcend) all I have done, or could do. But it seem’d to me, as the objects in Nature, the themes of aestheticism, and all special exploitations of the mind and soul, involve not only their own inherent quality, but the quality, just as inherent and important, of <em>their point of view</em>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> the time had come to reflect all themes and things, old and new, in the lights thrown on them by the advent of America and democracy⁠—to chant those themes through the utterance of one, not only the grateful and reverent legatee of the past, but the born child of the New World⁠—to illustrate all through the genesis and ensemble of today; and that such illustration and ensemble are the chief demands of America’s prospective imaginative literature. Not to carry out, in the approved style, some choice plot of fortune or misfortune, or fancy, or fine thoughts, or incidents, or courtesies⁠—all of which has been done overwhelmingly and well, probably never to be excell’d⁠—but that while in such aesthetic presentation of objects, passions, plots, thoughts, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, our lands and days do not want, and probably will never have, anything better than they already possess from the bequests of the past, it still remains to be said that there is even towards all those a subjective and contemporary point of view appropriate to ourselves alone, and to our new genius and environments, differing from anything hitherto; and that such conception of current or gone-by life and art is for us the only means of their assimilation consistent with the Western world.</p>
			<p>Indeed, and anyhow, to put it specifically, has not the time arrived when, (if it must be plainly said, for democratic America’s sake, if for no other) there must imperatively come a readjustment of the whole theory and nature of Poetry? The question is important, and I may turn the argument over and repeat it: Does not the best thought of our day and Republic conceive of a birth and spirit of song superior to anything past or present? To the effectual and moral consolidation of our lands (already, as materially establish’d, the greatest factors in known history, and far, far greater through what they prelude and necessitate, and are to be in future)⁠—to conform with and build on the concrete realities and theories of the universe furnish’d by science, and henceforth the only irrefragable basis for anything, verse included⁠—to root both influences in the emotional and imaginative action of the modern time, and dominate all that precedes or opposes them⁠—is not either a radical advance and step forward, or a new verteber of the best song indispensable?</p>
			<p>The New World receives with joy the poems of the antique with European feudalism’s rich fund of epics, plays, ballads⁠—seeks not in the least to deaden or displace those voices from our ear and area⁠—holds them indeed as indispensable studies, influences, records, comparisons. But though the dawn-dazzle of the sun of literature is in those poems for us of today⁠—though perhaps the best parts of current character in nations, social groups, or any man’s or woman’s individuality, Old World or New, are from them⁠—and though if I were ask’d to name the most precious bequest to current American civilization from all the hitherto ages, I am not sure but I would name those old and less old songs ferried hither from east and west⁠—some serious words and debits remain; some acrid considerations demand a hearing. Of the great poems receiv’d from abroad and from the ages, and today enveloping and penetrating America, is there one that is consistent with these United States, or essentially applicable to them as they are and are to be? Is there one whose underlying basis is not a denial and insult to democracy? What a comment it forms, anyhow, on this era of literary fulfilment, with the splendid day-rise of science and resuscitation of history, that our chief religious and poetical works are not our own, nor adapted to our light, but have been furnish’d by far-back ages out of their arrière and darkness, or, at most, twilight dimness! What is there in those works that so imperiously and scornfully dominates all our advanced civilization, and culture?</p>
			<p>Even Shakespeare, who so suffuses current letters and art (which indeed have in most degrees grown out of him,) belongs essentially to the buried past. Only he holds the proud distinction for certain important phases of that past, of being the loftiest of the singers life has yet given voice to. All, however, relate to and rest upon conditions, standards, politics, sociologies, ranges of belief, that have been quite eliminated from the Eastern hemisphere, and never existed at all in the Western. As authoritative types of song they belong in America just about as much as the persons and institutes they depict. True, it may be said, the emotional, moral, and aesthetic natures of humanity have not radically changed⁠—that in these the old poems apply to our times and all times, irrespective of date; and that they are of incalculable value as pictures of the past. I willingly make those admissions, and to their fullest extent; then advance the points herewith as of serious, even paramount importance.</p>
			<p>I have indeed put on record elsewhere my reverence and eulogy for those never-to-be-excell’d poetic bequests, and their indescribable preciousness as heirlooms for America. Another and separate point must now be candidly stated. If I had not stood before those poems with uncover’d head, fully aware of their colossal grandeur and beauty of form and spirit, I could not have written <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>. My verdict and conclusions as illustrated in its pages are arrived at through the temper and inculcation of the old works as much as through anything else⁠—perhaps more than through anything else. As America fully and fairly construed is the legitimate result and evolutionary outcome of the past, so I would dare to claim for my verse. Without stopping to qualify the averment, the Old World has had the poems of myths, fictions, feudalism, conquest, caste, dynastic wars, and splendid exceptional characters and affairs, which have been great; but the New World needs the poems of realities and science and of the democratic average and basic equality, which shall be greater. In the centre of all, and object of all, stands the Human Being, towards whose heroic and spiritual evolution poems and everything directly or indirectly tend, Old World or New.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Continuing the subject, my friends have more than once suggested⁠—or may be the garrulity of advancing age is possessing me⁠—some further embryonic facts of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, and especially how I enter’d upon them. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Bucke has, in his volume, already fully and fairly described the preparation of my poetic field, with the particular and general plowing, planting, seeding, and occupation of the ground, till everything was fertilized, rooted, and ready to start its own way for good or bad. Not till after all this, did I attempt any serious acquaintance with poetic literature. Along in my sixteenth year I had become possessor of a stout, well-cramm’d one thousand page octavo volume (I have it yet,) containing Walter Scott’s poetry entire⁠—an inexhaustible mine and treasury of poetic forage (especially the endless forests and jungles of notes)⁠—has been so to me for fifty years, and remains so to this day.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a></p>
			<p>Later, at intervals, summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for a week at a stretch, down in the country, or to Long Island’s seashores⁠—there, in the presence of outdoor influences, I went over thoroughly the Old and New Testaments, and absorb’d (probably to better advantage for me than in any library or indoor room⁠—it makes such difference <em>where</em> you read,) Shakespeare, Ossian, the best translated versions I could get of Homer, Eschylus, Sophocles, the old German Nibelungen, the ancient Hindu poems, and one or two other masterpieces, Dante’s among them. As it happen’d, I read the latter mostly in an old wood. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Iliad</i> (Buckley’s prose version) I read first thoroughly on the peninsula of Orient, northeast end of Long Island, in a shelter’d hollow of rocks and sand, with the sea on each side. (I have wonder’d since why I was not overwhelm’d by those mighty masters. Likely because I read them, as described, in the full presence of Nature, under the sun, with the far-spreading landscape and vistas, or the sea rolling in.)</p>
			<p>Toward the last I had among much else look’d over Edgar Poe’s poems⁠—of which I was not an admirer, though I always saw that beyond their limited range of melody (like perpetual chimes of music bells, ringing from lower B flat up to G) they were melodious expressions, and perhaps never excell’d ones, of certain pronounc’d phases of human morbidity. (The Poetic area is very spacious⁠—has room for all⁠—has so many mansions!) But I was repaid in Poe’s prose by the idea that (at any rate for our occasions, our day) there can be no such thing as a long poem. The same thought had been haunting my mind before, but Poe’s argument, though short, work’d the sum and proved it to me.</p>
			<p>Another point had an early settlement, clearing the ground greatly. I saw, from the time my enterprise and questionings positively shaped themselves (how best can I express my own distinctive era and surroundings, America, Democracy?) that the trunk and centre whence the answer was to radiate, and to which all should return from straying however far a distance, must be an identical body and soul, a personality⁠—which personality, after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settled should be myself⁠—indeed could not be any other. I also felt strongly (whether I have shown it or not) that to the true and full estimate of the Present both the Past and the Future are main considerations.</p>
			<p>These, however, and much more might have gone on and come to naught (almost positively would have come to naught,) if a sudden, vast, terrible, direct and indirect stimulus for new and national declamatory expression had not been given to me. It is certain, I say, that, although I had made a start before, only from the occurrence of the Secession War, and what it show’d me as by flashes of lightning, with the emotional depths it sounded and arous’d (of course, I don’t mean in my own heart only, I saw it just as plainly in others, in millions)⁠—that only from the strong flare and provocation of that war’s sights and scenes the final reasons-for-being of an autochthonic and passionate song definitely came forth.</p>
			<p>I went down to the war fields in Virginia (end of 1862), lived thenceforward in camp⁠—saw great battles and the days and nights afterward⁠—partook of all the fluctuations, gloom, despair, hopes again arous’d, courage evoked⁠—death readily risk’d⁠—<em>the cause</em>, too⁠—along and filling those agonistic and lurid following years, 1863⁠–⁠’64⁠–⁠’65⁠—the real parturition years (more than 1776⁠–⁠’83) of this henceforth homogeneous Union. Without those three or four years and the experiences they gave, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> would not now be existing.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>But I set out with the intention also of indicating or hinting some point-characteristics which I since see (though I did not then, at least not definitely) were bases and object-urgings toward those <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves</i> from the first. The word I myself put primarily for the description of them as they stand at last, is the word Suggestiveness. I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought⁠—there to pursue your own flight. Another impetus-word is Comradeship as for all lands, and in a more commanding and acknowledg’d sense than hitherto. Other word signs would be Good Cheer, Content, and Hope.</p>
			<p>The chief trait of any given poet is always the spirit he brings to the observation of Humanity and Nature⁠—the mood out of which he contemplates his subjects. What kind of temper and what amount of faith report these things? Up to how recent a date is the song carried? What the equipment, and special raciness of the singer⁠—what his tinge of coloring? The last value of artistic expressers, past and present⁠—Greek aesthetes, Shakespeare⁠—or in our own day Tennyson, Victor Hugo, Carlyle, Emerson⁠—is certainly involv’d in such questions. I say the profoundest service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader is not merely to satisfy the intellect, or supply something polish’d and interesting, nor even to depict great passions, or persons or events, but to fill him with vigorous and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him <em>good heart</em> as a radical possession and habit. The educated world seems to have been growing more and more ennuyed for ages, leaving to our time the inheritance of it all. Fortunately there is the original inexhaustible fund of buoyancy, normally resident in the race, forever eligible to be appeal’d to and relied on.</p>
			<p>As for native American individuality, though certain to come, and on a large scale, the distinctive and ideal type of Western character (as consistent with the operative political and even moneymaking features of United States’ humanity in the nineteenth century as chosen knights, gentlemen and warriors were the ideals of the centuries of European feudalism) it has not yet appear’d. I have allow’d the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear upon American individuality and assist it⁠—not only because that is a great lesson in Nature, amid all her generalizing laws, but as counterpoise to the leveling tendencies of Democracy⁠—and for other reasons. Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I avowedly chant “the great pride of man in himself,” and permit it to be more or less a motif of nearly all my verse. I think this pride indispensable to an American. I think it not inconsistent with obedience, humility, deference, and self-questioning.</p>
			<p>Democracy has been so retarded and jeopardized by powerful personalities, that its first instincts are fain to clip, conform, bring in stragglers, and reduce everything to a dead level. While the ambitious thought of my song is to help the forming of a great aggregate Nation, it is, perhaps, altogether through the forming of myriads of fully develop’d and enclosing individuals. Welcome as are equality’s and fraternity’s doctrines and popular education, a certain liability accompanies them all, as we see. That primal and interior something in man, in his soul’s abysms, coloring all, and, by exceptional fruitions, giving the last majesty to him⁠—something continually touch’d upon and attain’d by the old poems and ballads of feudalism, and often the principal foundation of them⁠—modern science and Democracy appear to be endangering, perhaps eliminating. But that forms an appearance only; the reality is quite different. The new influences, upon the whole, are surely preparing the way for grander individualities than ever. Today and here personal force is behind everything, just the same. The times and depictions from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Iliad</i> to Shakespeare inclusive can happily never again be realized⁠—but the elements of courageous and lofty manhood are unchanged.</p>
			<p>Without yielding an inch the workingman and working-woman were to be in my pages from first to last. The ranges of heroism and loftiness with which Greek and feudal poets endow’d their godlike or lordly born characters⁠—indeed prouder and better based and with fuller ranges than those⁠—I was to endow the democratic averages of America. I was to show that we, here and today, are eligible to the grandest and the best⁠—more eligible now than any times of old were. I will also want my utterances (I said to myself before beginning) to be in spirit the poems of the morning. (They have been founded and mainly written in the sunny forenoon and early midday of my life.) I will want them to be the poems of women entirely as much as men. I have wish’d to put the complete Union of the States in my songs without any preference or partiality whatever. Henceforth, if they live and are read, it must be just as much South as North⁠—just as much along the Pacific as Atlantic⁠—in the valley of the Mississippi, in Canada, up in Maine, down in Texas, and on the shores of Puget Sound.</p>
			<p>From another point of view <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even Animality⁠—though meanings that do not usually go along with those words are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere. Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted. Difficult as it will be, it has become, in my opinion, imperative to achieve a shifted attitude from superior men and women towards the thought and fact of sexuality, as an element in character, personality, the emotions, and a theme in literature. I am not going to argue the question by itself; it does not stand by itself. The vitality of it is altogether in its relations, bearings, significance⁠—like the clef of a symphony. At last analogy the lines I allude to, and the spirit in which they are spoken, permeate all <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, and the work must stand or fall with them, as the human body and soul must remain as an entirety.</p>
			<p>Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities or individuals all times, there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that “heroic nudity”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> on which only a genuine diagnosis of serious cases can be built. And in respect to editions of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do so, any elision of them.</p>
			<p>Then still a purpose enclosing all, and over and beneath all. Ever since what might be call’d thought, or the budding of thought, fairly began in my youthful mind, I had had a desire to attempt some worthy record of that entire faith and acceptance (“to justify the ways of God to men” is Milton’s well-known and ambitious phrase) which is the foundation of moral America. I felt it all as positively then in my young days as I do now in my old ones; to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object, every human or other existence, not only consider’d from the point of view of all, but of each.</p>
			<p>While I cannot understand it or argue it out, I fully believe in a clue and purpose in nature, entire and several; and that invisible spiritual results, just as real and definite as the visible, eventuate all concrete life and all materialism, through Time. My book ought to emanate buoyancy and gladness legitimately enough, for it was grown out of those elements, and has been the comfort of my life since it was originally commenced.</p>
			<p>One main genesis-motive of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves</i> was my conviction (just as strong today as ever) that the crowning growth of the United States is to be spiritual and heroic. To help start and favor that growth⁠—or even to call attention to it, or the need of it⁠—is the beginning, middle, and final purpose of the poems. (In fact, when really cipher’d out and summ’d to the last, plowing up in earnest the interminable average fallows of humanity⁠—not “good government” merely, in the common sense⁠—is the justification and main purpose of these United States.)</p>
			<p>Isolated advantages in any rank or grace or fortune⁠—the direct or indirect threads of all the poetry of the past⁠—are in my opinion distasteful to the republican genius, and offer no foundation for its fitting verse. Establish’d poems, I know, have the very great advantage of chanting the already perform’d, so full of glories, reminiscences dear to the minds of men. But my volume is a candidate for the future. “All original art,” says Taine, anyhow, “is self-regulated, and no original art can be regulated from without; it carries its own counterpoise, and does not receive it from elsewhere⁠—lives on its own blood”⁠—a solace to my frequent bruises and sulky vanity.</p>
			<p>As the present is perhaps mainly an attempt at personal statement or illustration, I will allow myself as further help to extract the following anecdote from a book, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Annals of Old Painters</i>, conn’d by me in youth. Rubens, the Flemish painter, in one of his wanderings through the galleries of old convents, came across a singular work. After looking at it thoughtfully for a good while, and listening to the criticisms of his suite of students, he said to the latter, in answer to their questions, (as to what school the work implied or belong’d,) “I do not believe the artist, unknown and perhaps no longer living, who has given the world this legacy, ever belong’d to any school, or ever painted anything but this one picture, which is a personal affair⁠—a piece out of a man’s life.”</p>
			<p><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> indeed (I cannot too often reiterate) has mainly been the outcropping of my own emotional and other personal nature⁠—an attempt, from first to last, to put <em>a Person</em>, a human being (myself, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, in America,) freely, fully and truly on record. I could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me. But it is not on <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> distinctively as <em>literature</em>, or a specimen thereof, that I feel to dwell, or advance claims. No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or attempt at such performance, or as aiming mainly toward art or aestheticism.</p>
			<p>I say no land or people or circumstances ever existed so needing a race of singers and poems differing from all others, and rigidly their own, as the land and people and circumstances of our United States need such singers and poems today, and for the future. Still further, as long as the States continue to absorb and be dominated by the poetry of the Old World, and remain unsupplied with autochthonous song, to express, vitalize and give color to and define their material and political success, and minister to them distinctively, so long will they stop short of first-class Nationality and remain defective.</p>
			<p>In the free evening of my day I give to you, reader, the foregoing garrulous talk, thoughts, reminiscences,</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>As idly drifting down the ebb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such ripples, half-caught voices, echo from the shore.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Concluding with two items for the imaginative genius of the West, when it worthily rises⁠—First, what Herder taught to the young Goethe, that really great poetry is always (like the Homeric or Biblical canticles) the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polish’d and select few; Second, that the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.</p>
