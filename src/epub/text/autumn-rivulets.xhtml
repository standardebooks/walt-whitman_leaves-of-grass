					<span>As consequent from store of summer rains,</span>

					<span>Or wayward rivulets in autumn flowing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or many a herb-lined brook’s reticulations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or subterranean sea-rills making for the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Songs of continued years I sing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Life’s ever-modern rapids first, (soon, soon to blend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the old streams of death.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Some threading Ohio’s farm-fields or the woods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some down Colorado’s canyons from sources of perpetual snow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some half-hid in Oregon, or away southward in Texas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some in the north finding their way to Erie, Niagara, Ottawa,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some to Atlantica’s bays, and so to the great salt brine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In you whoe’er you are my book perusing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In I myself, in all the world, these currents flowing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All, all toward the mystic ocean tending.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Currents for starting a continent new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fusion of ocean and land, tender and pensive waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Not safe and peaceful only, waves rous’d and ominous too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the depths the storm’s abysmic waves, who knows whence?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and tatter’d sail.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or from the sea of Time, collecting vasting all, I bring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A windrow-drift of weeds and shells.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O little shells, so curious-convolute, so limpid-cold and voiceless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will you not little shells to the tympans of temples held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmurs and echoes still call up, eternity’s music faint and far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wafted inland, sent from Atlantica’s rim, strains for the soul of the prairies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whisper’d reverberations, chords for the ear of the West joyously sounding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Infinitesimals out of my life, and many a life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For not my life and years alone I give⁠—all, all I give,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These waifs from the deep, cast high and dry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wash’d on America’s shores?</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">There Was a Child Went Forth</h3>
				<p>
					<span>There was a child went forth every day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the first object he look’d upon, that object he became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or for many years or stretching cycles of years.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The early lilacs became part of this child,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And grass and white and red morning-glories, and white and red clover, and the song of the phoebe-bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Third-month lambs and the sow’s pink-faint litter, and the mare’s foal and the cow’s calf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond-side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there, and the beautiful curious liquid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads, all became part of him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part of him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Winter-grain sprouts and those of the light-yellow corn, and the esculent roots of the garden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the apple-trees cover’d with blossoms and the fruit afterward, and wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the tavern whence he had lately risen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the schoolmistress that pass’d on her way to the school,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the friendly boys that pass’d, and the quarrelsome boys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the tidy and fresh-cheek’d girls, and the barefoot negro boy and girl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the changes of city and country wherever he went.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His own parents, he that had father’d him and she that had conceiv’d him in her womb and birth’d him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They gave this child more of themselves than that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They gave him afterward every day, they became part of him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mother with mild words, clean her cap and gown, a wholesome odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger’d, unjust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture, the yearning and swelling heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Affection that will not be gainsay’d, the sense of what is real, the thought if after all it should prove unreal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time, the curious whether and how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men and women crowding fast in the streets, if they are not flashes and specks what are they?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The streets themselves and the façades of houses, and goods in the windows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank’d wharves, the huge crossing at the ferries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset, the river between,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of white or brown two miles off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide, the little boat slack-tow’d astern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strata of color’d clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The horizon’s edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh and shore mud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now goes, and will always go forth every day.</span>

						<span>I do not see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I am deceiv’d,</span>

						<span>The grass of spring covers the prairies,</span>

						<span>The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,</span>

						<span>The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,</span>

					<p>
						<span>What chemistry!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That the winds are really not infectious,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea which is so amorous after me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves in it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all is clean forever and forever,</span>

						<span>That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,</span>

						<span>That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That the fruits of the apple-orchard and the orange-orchard, that melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once a catching disease.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now I am terrified at the Earth, it is that calm and patient,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless successions of diseas’d corpses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from them at last.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Courage yet, my brother or my sister!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keep on⁠—Liberty is to be subserv’d whatever occurs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is nothing that is quell’d by one or two failures, or any number of failures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any unfaithfulness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and light, is positive and composed, knows no discouragement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Waiting patiently, waiting its time.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Not songs of loyalty alone are these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But songs of insurrection also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stakes his life to be lost at any moment.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and retreat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The infidel triumphs, or supposes he triumphs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron necklace and lead-balls do their work,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The great speakers and writers are exiled, they lie sick in distant lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cause is asleep, the strongest throats are choked with their own blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the infidel enter’d into full possession.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go, nor the second or third to go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from any part of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from that part of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the infidel come into full possession.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then courage European revolter, revoltress!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For till all ceases neither must you cease.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what I am for myself, nor what any thing is for,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I will search carefully for it even in being foil’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment⁠—for they too are great.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Did we think victory great?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So it is⁠—but now it seems to me, when it cannot be help’d, that defeat is great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that death and dismay are great.</span>

					<span>Garner’d clusters of ages that men and women like us grew up and travel’d their course and pass’d on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What vast-built cities, what orderly republics, what pastoral tribes and nomads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others,</span>

					<span>What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What sort of marriage, what costumes, what physiology and phrenology,</span>

					<span>Who were witty and wise, who beautiful and poetic, who brutish and undevelop’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not a mark, not a record remains⁠—and yet all remains.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O I know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more than we are for nothing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much as we now belong to it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Afar they stand, yet near to me they stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some with oval countenances learn’d and calm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some naked and savage, some like huge collections of insects,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some in tents, herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some prowling through woods, some living peaceably on farms, laboring, reaping, filling barns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories, libraries, shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Are those billions of men really gone?</span>

					<span>Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?</span>

					<span>Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I believe of all those men and women that fill’d the unnamed lands, every one exists this hour here or elsewhere, invisible to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and out of what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinn’d, in life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of them, any more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products, games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world, counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I suspect I shall meet them there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands.</span>

			<article id="song-of-prudence" epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<h3 epub:type="title">Song of Prudence</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Manhattan’s streets I saunter’d pondering,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Time, Space, Reality⁠—on such as these, and abreast with them Prudence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that suits immortality.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The soul is of itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All verges to it, all has reference to what ensues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day, month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect lifetime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The indirect is just as much as the direct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body, if not more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of the onanist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning, betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But has results beyond death as really as before death.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Charity and personal force are the only investments worth anything.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No specification is necessary, all that a male or female does, that is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope of it forever.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who has been wise receives interest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Savage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat, young, old, it is the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The interest will come round⁠—all will come round.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect, all of the past and all of the present and all of the future,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the brave actions of war and peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful, young children, widows, the sick, and to shunn’d persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others fill the seats of the boats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a friend’s sake, or opinion’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All pains of enthusiasts scoff’d at by their neighbors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name, date, location,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his mouth, or the shaping of his great hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe, or on any of the wandering stars, or on any of the fix’d stars, by those there as we are here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are, or by any one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which they sprang, or shall spring.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Did you guess anything lived only its moment?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world does not so exist, no parts palpable or impalpable so exist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No consummation exists without being from some long previous consummation, and that from some other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the beginning than any.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whatever satisfies souls is true;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Itself only finally satisfies the soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson but its own.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time, space, reality,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What is prudence is indivisible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Declines to separate one part of life from every part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Matches every thought or act by its correlative,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knows that the young man who composedly peril’d his life and lost it has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he who never peril’d his life, but retains it to old age in riches and ease, has probably achiev’d nothing for himself worth mentioning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knows that only that person has really learn’d who has learn’d to prefer results,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who favors body and soul the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor avoids death.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Blue-bird and darting swallow, nor forget the high-hole flashing his golden wings,</span>

					<span>Editor, author, artist, and schoolboy⁠—draw nigh and commence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is no lesson⁠—it lets down the bars to a good lesson,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that to another, and every one to another still.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The great laws take and effuse without argument,</span>

					<span>I am of the same style, for I am their friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I love them quits and quits, I do not halt and make salaams.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons of things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I cannot say to any person what I hear⁠—I cannot say it to myself⁠—it is very wonderful.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It is no small matter, this round and delicious globe moving so exactly in its orbit forever and ever, without one jolt or the untruth of a single second,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor ten billions of years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor plann’d and built one thing after another as an architect plans and builds a house.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me, or any one else.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Is it wonderful that I should be immortal? as every one is immortal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know it is wonderful, but my eyesight is equally wonderful, and how I was conceived in my mother’s womb is equally wonderful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pass’d from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of summers and winters to articulate and walk⁠—all this is equally wonderful.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is every bit as wonderful.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true, is just as wonderful.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth, is equally wonderful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally wonderful.</span>

				<p>
					<span>O star of France,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beseems to-day a wreck driven by the gale, a mastless hulk,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dim smitten star,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Orb not of France alone, pale symbol of my soul, its dearest hopes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The struggle and the daring, rage divine for liberty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of aspirations toward the far ideal, enthusiast’s dreams of brotherhood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of terror to the tyrant and the priest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Star crucified⁠—by traitors sold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Star panting o’er a land of death, heroic land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell’d them all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left thee sacred.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg’d sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that alone among thy sisters thou, giantess, didst rend the ones that shamed thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The spear thrust in thy side.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O star! O ship of France, beat back and baffled long!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bear up O smitten orb! O ship continue on!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sure as the ship of all, the Earth itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty,</span>

					<span>Onward beneath the sun following its course,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Finish’d the days, the clouds dispel’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The travail o’er, the long-sought extrication,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When lo! reborn, high o’er the European world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(In gladness answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours Columbia,)</span>
					<br/>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Ox-Tamer</h3>
				<p>
					<span>In a far-away northern county in the placid pastoral region,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, a famous tamer of oxen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There they bring him the three-year-olds and the four-year-olds to break them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and tame him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock chafes up and down the yard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bullock’s head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet see you! how soon his rage subsides⁠—how soon this tamer tames him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See you! on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old, and he is the man who has tamed them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all know him, all are affectionate to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See you! some are such beautiful animals, so lofty looking;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some are buff-color’d, some mottled, one has a white line running along his back, some are brindled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)⁠—see you! the bright hides,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See, the two with stars on their foreheads⁠—see, the round bodies and broad backs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How straight and square they stand on their legs⁠—what fine sagacious eyes!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How they watch their tamer⁠—they wish him near them⁠—how they turn to look after him!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves away from them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics, poems, depart⁠—all else departs,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I confess I envy only his fascination⁠—my silent, illiterate friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the northern county far, in the placid pastoral region.</span>
