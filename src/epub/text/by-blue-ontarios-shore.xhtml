						<span>By blue Ontario’s shore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I mused of these warlike days and of peace return’d, and the dead that return no more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Phantom gigantic superb, with stern visage accosted me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><q>Chant me the poem,</q> it said, <q>that comes from the soul of America, chant me the carol of victory,</q></span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<q>And strike up the marches of Libertad, marches more powerful yet,</q>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<q>And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy.</q>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>(Democracy, the destin’d conqueror, yet treacherous lip-smiles everywhere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And death and infidelity at every step.)</span>

						<span>I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,</span>

						<span>I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A breed whose proof is in time and deeds,</span>

						<span>What we are we are, nativity is answer enough to objections,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We are executive in ourselves, we are sufficient in the variety of ourselves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We stand self-pois’d in the middle, branching thence over the world,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,</span>

						<span>Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>America brings builders, and brings its own styles.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work and pass’d to other spheres,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all hazards,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, initiates the true use of precedents,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced under their forms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne from the house,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perceives that it waits a little while in the door, that it was fittest for its days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who approaches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that he shall be fittest for his days.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Any period one nation must lead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>These States are the amplest poem,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the day and night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of particulars,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the soul loves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here the flowing trains, here the crowds, equality, diversity, the soul loves.</span>

						<span>Land of lands and bards to corroborate!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of them standing among them, one lifts to the light a west-bred face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To him the hereditary countenance bequeath’d both mother’s and father’s,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its neck with incomparable love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes, Columbia, Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,</span>

						<span>If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch, he stretching with them North or South,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine, cedar, hemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, orange, magnolia,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with northern transparent ice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish-hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His spirit surrounding his country’s spirit, unclosed to good and evil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and muscle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The haughty defiance of the Year One, war, peace, the formation of the Constitution,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The separate States, the simple elastic scheme, the immigrants,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and impregnable,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The unsurvey’d interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals, hunters, trappers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the gestation of new States,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up from the uttermost parts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially the young men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships, the gait they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and decision of their phrenology,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when wrong’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity, good temper and open-handedness, the whole composite make,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement of the population,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wharf-hemm’d cities, railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all points,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the Northeast, Northwest, Southwest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slavery⁠—the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the ruins of all the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On and on to the grapple with it⁠—Assassin! then your life or ours be the stake, and respite no more.</span>

						<span>To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no account,</span>

						<span>Of these States the poet is the equable man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not in him but off from him things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of their full returns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither more nor less,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He is the equalizer of his age and land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He supplies what wants supplying, he checks what wants checking,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture, arts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the soul, health, immortality, government,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In war he is the best backer of the war, he fetches artillery as good as the engineer’s, he can make every word he speaks draw blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He is no arguer, he is judgment, (Nature accepts him absolutely,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun falling round a helpless thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he sees the farthest he has the most faith,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sees eternity in men and women, he does not see men and women as dreams or dots.</span>

						<span>Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,</span>

						<span>Read these leaves to myself in the open air, tried them by trees, stars, rivers,</span>

						<span>Dismiss’d whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body,</span>

						<span>I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is not the earth, it is not America who is so great,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is I who am great or to be great, it is You up there, or any one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Underneath all, individuals,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The American compact is altogether with individuals,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single individual⁠—namely to You.</span>
					</p>
					<p>

						<br/>
						<span>I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)</span>

						<span>Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.</span>

						<span>O I see flashing that this America is only you and me,</span>

						<span>Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, are you and me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its Congress is you and me, the officers, capitols, armies, ships, are you and me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The war, (that war so bloody and grim, the war I will henceforth forget), was you and me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Natural and artificial are you and me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past, present, future, are you and me.</span>

					<p>
						<span>I dare not shirk any part of myself,</span>

						<span>Not any part of America good or bad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not to build for that which builds for mankind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,</span>

						<span>Not to justify science nor the march of equality,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belov’d of time.</span>

						<span>Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)</span>

						<br/>
						<span>While the winds fann’d me and the waves came trooping toward me,</span>
