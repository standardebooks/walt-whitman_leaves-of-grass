					<h3 epub:type="title">A Boston Ballad</h3>
					<p epub:type="bridgehead">(1854)</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here’s a good place at the corner, I must stand and see the show.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Clear the way there Jonathan!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Way for the President’s marshal⁠—way for the government cannon!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Way for the Federal foot and dragoons, (and the apparitions copiously tumbling.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I love to look on the Stars and Stripes, I hope the fifes will play Yankee Doodle.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why this is indeed a show⁠—it has called the dead out of the earth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cock’d hats of mothy mould⁠—crutches made of mist!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arms in slings⁠—old men leaning on young men’s shoulders.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What troubles you Yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of bare gums?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches for firelocks and level them?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President’s marshal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For shame old maniacs⁠—bring down those toss’d arms, and let your white hair be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here gape your great-grandsons, their wives gaze at them from the windows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See how well dress’d, see how orderly they conduct themselves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Worse and worse⁠—can’t you stand it? are you retreating?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is this hour with the living too dead for you?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Retreat then⁠—pell-mell!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To your graves⁠—back⁠—back to the hills old limpers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think you belong here anyhow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But there is one thing that belongs here⁠—shall I tell you what it is, gentlemen of Boston?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the royal vault,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dig out King George’s coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-clothes, box up his bones for a journey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Find a swift Yankee clipper⁠—here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up with your anchor⁠—shake out your sails⁠—steer straight toward Boston bay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now call for the President’s marshal again, bring out the government cannon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession, guard it with foot and dragoons.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This centre-piece for them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look, all orderly citizens⁠—look from the windows, women!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that will not stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You have got your revenge, old buster⁠—the crown is come to its own, and more than its own.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan⁠—you are a made man from this day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You are mighty cute⁠—and here is one of your bargains.</span>

					<p epub:type="bridgehead">The 72nd and 73rd Years of These States</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like lightning it le’pt forth half startled at itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its feet upon the ashes and the rags, its hands tight to the throats of kings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O hope and faith!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O aching close of exiled patriots’ lives!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O many a sicken’d heart!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And you, paid to defile the People⁠—you liars, mark!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his simplicity the poor man’s wages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh’d at in the breaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge, or the heads of the nobles fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The People scorn’d the ferocity of kings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the sweetness of mercy brew’d bitter destruction, and the frighten’d monarchs come back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each comes in state with his train, hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in scarlet folds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose face and eyes none may see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of its robes only this, the red robes lifted by the arm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One finger crook’d pointed high over the top, like the head of a snake appears.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves, bloody corpses of young men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all these things bear fruits, and they are good.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Those corpses of young men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets, those hearts pierc’d by the gray lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter’d vitality.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They live in other young men O kings!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They live in brothers again ready to defy you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were purified by death, they were taught and exalted.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not a grave of the murder’d for freedom but grows seed for freedom, in its turn to bear seed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows nourish.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling, cautioning.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Liberty, let others despair of you⁠—I never despair of you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Is the house shut? is the master away?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nevertheless, be ready, be not weary of watching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He will soon return, his messengers come anon.</span>

					<span>Hold it up sternly⁠—see this it sends back, (who is it? is it you?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outside fair costume, within ashes and filth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more a flashing eye, no more a sonorous voice or springy step,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now some slave’s eye, voice, hands, step,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Lungs rotting away piecemeal, stomach sour and cankerous,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>I observe a famine at sea, I observe the sailors casting lots who shall be kill’d to preserve the lives of the rest,</span>

					<span>A thousand perfect men and women appear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around each gathers a cluster of friends, and gay children and youths, with offerings.</span>

					<span>Why reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What deepening twilight⁠—scum floating atop of the waters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who are they as bats and night-dogs askant in the capitol?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What a filthy Presidentiad! (O South, your torrid suns! O North, your arctic freezings!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are those really Congressmen? are those the great Judges? is that the President?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I will sleep awhile yet, for I see that these States sleep, for reasons;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(With gathering murk, with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we all duly awake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>South, North, East, West, inland and seaboard, we will surely awake.)</span>
