				<p>
					<span>From pent-up aching rivers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that of myself without which I were nothing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From what I am determin’d to make illustrious, even if I stand sole among men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From my own voice resonant, singing the phallus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singing the song of procreation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singing the need of superb children and therein superb grown people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singing the muscular urge and the blending,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singing the bedfellow’s song, (O resistless yearning!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O for any and each the body correlative attracting!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O for you whoever you are your correlative body! O it, more than all else, you delighting!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From native moments, from bashful pains, singing them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeking something yet unfound though I have diligently sought it many a long year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singing the true song of the soul fitful at random,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Renascent with grossest Nature or among animals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that, of them and what goes with them my poems informing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the smell of apples and lemons, of the pairing of birds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the wet of woods, of the lapping of waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the mad pushes of waves upon the land, I them chanting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The overture lightly sounding, the strain anticipating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The welcome nearness, the sight of the perfect body,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The swimmer swimming naked in the bath, or motionless on his back lying and floating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The female form approaching, I pensive, love-flesh tremulous aching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The divine list for myself or you or for any one making,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The face, the limbs, the index from head to foot, and what it arouses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mystic deliria, the madness amorous, the utter abandonment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Hark close and still what I now whisper to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I love you, O you entirely possess me,</span>

					<span>O that you and I escape from the rest and go utterly off, free and lawless,</span>

					<span>The oath of the inseparableness of two together, of the woman that loves me and whom I love more than my life, that oath swearing,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>O you and I! what is it to us what the rest do or think?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is all else to us? only that we enjoy each other and exhaust each other if it must be so;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the master, the pilot I yield the vessel to,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The general commanding me, commanding all, from him permission taking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From time the programme hastening, (I have loiter’d too long as it is,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From sex, from the warp and from the woof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From privacy, from frequent repinings alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingers through my hair and beard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the long sustain’d kiss upon the mouth or bosom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk, fainting with excess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From what the divine husband knows, from the work of fatherhood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From exultation, victory and relief, from the bedfellow’s embrace in the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the act-poems of eyes, hands, hips and bosoms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the cling of the trembling arm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the bending curve and the clinch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From side by side the pliant coverlet off-throwing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the one so unwilling to have me leave, and me just as unwilling to leave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Yet a moment O tender waiter, and I return,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the night a moment I emerging flitting out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for,</span>

						<span>The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The expression of the face balks account,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The sprawl and fullness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water,</span>

						<span>The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown after work,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trousers and waist-straps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such-like I love⁠—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child,</span>

					<p>
						<span>This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,</span>

						<span>The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,</span>

					<span>Yet all were lacking if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the right man were lacking.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sex contains all, bodies, souls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results, promulgations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal milk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, all the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the governments, judges, gods, follow’d persons of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These are contain’d in sex as parts of itself and justifications of itself.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that are warm-blooded and sufficient for me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see that they understand me and do not deny me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see that they are worthy of me, I will be the robust husband of those women.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They are not one jot less than I am,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are tann’d in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are ultimate in their own right⁠—they are calm, clear, well-possess’d of themselves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I draw you close to me, you women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot let you go, I would do you good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake, but for others’ sakes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Envelop’d in you sleep greater heroes and bards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It is I, you women, I make my way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable, but I love you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States, I press with slow rude muscle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I brace myself effectually, I listen to no entreaties,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated within me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In you I wrap a thousand onward years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and America,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls, new artists, musicians, and singers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love-spendings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you interpenetrate now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as I count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death, immortality, I plant so lovingly now.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Spontaneous me, Nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The loving day, the mounting sun, the friend I am happy with,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hillside whiten’d with blossoms of the mountain ash,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same late in autumn, the hues of red, yellow, drab, purple, and light and dark green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rich coverlet of the grass, animals and birds, the private untrimm’d bank, the primitive apples, the pebble-stones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beautiful dripping fragments, the negligent list of one after another as I happen to call them to me or think of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The real poems, (what we call poems being merely pictures,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The poems of the privacy of the night, and of men like me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry, and that all men carry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Know once for all, avow’d on purpose, wherever are men like me, are our lusty lurking masculine poems,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love-thoughts, love-juice, love-odor, love-yielding, love-climbers, and the climbing sap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arms and hands of love, lips of love, phallic thumb of love, breasts of love, bellies press’d and glued together with love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earth of chaste love, life that is only life after love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The body of my love, the body of the woman I love, the body of the man, the body of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south-west,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hairy wild-bee that murmurs and hankers up and down, that gripes the full-grown lady-flower, curves upon her with amorous firm legs, takes his will of her, and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is satisfied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wet of woods through the early hours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep, one with an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The smell of apples, aromas from crush’d sage-plant, mint, birch-bark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The boy’s longings, the glow and pressure as he confides to me what he was dreaming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and content to the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The no-form’d stings that sights, people, objects, sting me with,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hubb’d sting of myself, stinging me as much as it ever can any one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sensitive, orbic, underlapp’d brothers, that only privileged feelers may be intimate where they are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body, the bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and edge themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The limpid liquid within the young man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The vex’d corrosion so pensive and so painful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The torment, the irritable tide that will not be at rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The like of the same I feel, the like of the same in others,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young man that flushes and flushes, and the young woman that flushes and flushes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young man that wakes deep at night, the hot hand seeking to repress what would master him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mystic amorous night, the strange half-welcome pangs, visions, sweats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers, the young man all color’d, red, ashamed, angry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie willing and naked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the sun, the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and the ripening or ripen’d long-round walnuts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The continence of vegetables, birds, animals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent, while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The great chastity of paternity, to match the great chastity of maternity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The oath of procreation I have sworn, my Adamic and fresh daughters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw, till I saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wholesome relief, repose, content,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this bunch pluck’d at random from myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It has done its work⁠—I toss it carelessly to fall where it may.</span>

					<span>To be absolv’d from previous ties and conventions, I from mine and you from yours!</span>

					<span>To find a new unthought-of nonchalance with the best of Nature!</span>

					<span>To have the gag remov’d from one’s mouth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have the feeling to-day or any day I am sufficient as I am.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O something unprov’d! something in a trance!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To escape utterly from others’ anchors and holds!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To drive free! to love free! to dash reckless and dangerous!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To court destruction with taunts, with invitations!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To ascend, to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To rise thither with my inebriate soul!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be lost if it must be so!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fullness and freedom!</span>

					<span>With one brief hour of madness and joy.</span>
