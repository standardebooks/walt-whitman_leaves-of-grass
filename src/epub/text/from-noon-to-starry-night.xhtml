				<p>
					<span>Thou orb aloft full-dazzling! thou hot October noon!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hear me illustrious!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy lover me, for always I have loved thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood edge, thy touching-distant beams enough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know before the fitting man all Nature yields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though answering not in words, the skies, trees, hear his voice⁠—and thou O sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for thy throes, thy perturbations, sudden breaks and shafts of flame gigantic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I understand them, I know those flames, those perturbations well.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thou that with fructifying heat and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er myriad farms, o’er lands and waters North and South,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er Mississippi’s endless course, o’er Texas’ grassy plains, Kanada’s woods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting ray out of thy million millions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strike through these chants.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prepare the later afternoon of me myself⁠—prepare my lengthening shadows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prepare my starry nights.</span>

						<span>Sauntering the pavement or riding the country by-road, lo, such faces!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The spiritual-prescient face, the always welcome common benevolent face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The face of the singing of music, the grand faces of natural lawyers and judges broad at the back-top,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The faces of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows, the shaved blanch’d faces of orthodox citizens,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist’s face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the handsome detested or despised face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the mother of many children,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The face of an amour, the face of veneration,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wild hawk, his wings clipp’d by the clipper,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the gelder.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Sauntering the pavement thus, or crossing the ceaseless ferry, faces and faces and faces,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see them and complain not, and am content with all.</span>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="faces-2" epub:type="part">

					<p>
						<span>Do you suppose I could be content with all if I thought them their own finalè?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This now is too lamentable a face for a man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing for it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig to its hole.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This face is a dog’s snout sniffing for garbage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snakes nest in that mouth, I hear the sibilant threat.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its sleepy and wabbling icebergs crunch as they go.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they need no label,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog’s-lard.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till they show nothing but their whites,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the turn’d-in nails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground, while he speculates well.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This face is bitten by vermin and worms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this is some murderer’s knife with a half-pull’d scabbard.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An unceasing death-bell tolls there.</span>

						<span>Features of my equals would you trick me with your creas’d and cadaverous march?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well, you cannot trick me.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I see your rounded never-erased flow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see ’neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Splay and twist as you like, poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You’ll be unmuzzled, you certainly will.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I saw the face of the most smear’d and slobbering idiot they had at the asylum,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I knew for my consolation what they knew not,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I shall look again in a score or two of ages,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharm’d, every inch as good as myself.</span>

						<span>The Lord advances, and yet advances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Always the shadow in front, always the reach’d hand bringing up the laggards.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Out of this face emerge banners and horses⁠—O superb! I see what is coming,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see the high pioneer-caps, see staves of runners clearing the way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I hear victorious drums.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This face is a life-boat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no odds of the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This face is flavor’d fruit ready for eating,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They show their descent from the Master himself.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Off the word I have spoken I except not one⁠—red, white, black, are all deific,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In each house is the ovum, it comes forth after a thousand years.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs to me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I read the promise and patiently wait.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This is a full-grown lily’s face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She speaks to the limber-hipp’d man near the garden pickets,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><q>Come here</q> she blushingly cries, <q>Come nigh to me limber-hipp’d man,</q></span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<q>Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you,</q>

						<br/>
						<span>
							<q>Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me,</q>

						<span>The old face of the mother of many children,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whist! I am fully content.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Lull’d and late is the smoke of the First-day morning,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It hangs thin by the sassafras and wild-cherry and cat-brier under them.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I heard what the singers were singing so long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the water-blue.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Behold a woman!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is clearer and more beautiful than the sky.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sun just shines on her old white head.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-daughters spun it with the distaff and the wheel.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The melodious character of the earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to go,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The justified mother of men.</span>

					<span>O the strange fascination of these half-known half-impassable swamps, infested by reptiles, resounding with the bellow of the alligator, the sad noises of the night-owl and the wild-cat, and the whirr of the rattlesnake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all the forenoon, singing through the moon-lit night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The humming-bird, the wild turkey, the raccoon, the opossum;</span>

					<span>A Kentucky corn-field, the tall, graceful, long-leav’d corn, slender, flapping, bright green, with tassels, with beautiful ears each well-sheath’d in its husk;</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Mannahatta</h3>
				<p>
					<span>I was asking for something specific and perfect for my city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereupon lo! upsprang the aboriginal name.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I see what there is in a name, a word, liquid, sane, unruly, musical, self-sufficient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see that the word of my city is that word from of old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because I see that word nested in nests of water-bays, superb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rich, hemm’d thick all around with sailships and steamships, an island sixteen miles long, solid-founded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Numberless crowded streets, high growths of iron, slender, strong, light, splendidly uprising toward clear skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tides swift and ample, well-loved by me, toward sundown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flowing sea-currents, the little islands, larger adjoining islands, the heights, the villas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The countless masts, the white shore-steamers, the lighters, the ferry-boats, the black sea-steamers well-model’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The down-town streets, the jobbers’ houses of business, the houses of business of the ship-merchants and money-brokers, the river-streets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Immigrants arriving, fifteen or twenty thousand in a week,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The carts hauling goods, the manly race of drivers of horses, the brown-faced sailors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The summer air, the bright sun shining, and the sailing clouds aloft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The winter snows, the sleigh-bells, the broken ice in the river, passing along up or down with the flood-tide or ebb-tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mechanics of the city, the masters, well-form’d, beautiful-faced, looking you straight in the eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trottoirs throng’d, vehicles, Broadway, the women, the shops and shows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A million people⁠—manners free and superb⁠—open voices⁠—hospitality⁠—the most courageous and friendly young men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>City of hurried and sparkling waters! city of spires and masts!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>City nested in bays! my city!</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">All Is Truth</h3>
				<p>
					<span>O me, man of slack faith so long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Standing aloof, denying portions so long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only aware to-day of compact all-diffused truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Discovering to-day there is no lie or form of lie, and can be none, but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth does.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(This is curious and may not be realized immediately, but it must be realized,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that the universe does.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where has fail’d a perfect return indifferent of lies or the truth?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire? or in the spirit of man? or in the meat and blood?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself, I see that there are really no liars or lies after all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that nothing fails its perfect return, and that what are called lies are perfect returns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that each thing exactly represents itself and what has preceded it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that the truth includes all, and is compact just as much as space is compact,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truth⁠—but that all is truth without exception;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And henceforth I will go celebrate anything I see or am,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sing and laugh and deny nothing.</span>

				<p>
					<span>That which eludes this verse and any verse,</span>

					<span>Unheard by sharpest ear, unform’d in clearest eye or cunningest mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor lore nor fame, nor happiness nor wealth,</span>

					<span>And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world incessantly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open but still a secret, the real of the real, an illusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Costless, vouchsafed to each, yet never man the owner,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme, historians in prose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which sculptor never chisel’d yet, nor painter painted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which vocalist never sung, nor orator nor actor ever utter’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invoking here and now I challenge for my song.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Indifferently, ’mid public, private haunts, in solitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind the mountain and the wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Companion of the city’s busiest streets, through the assemblage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It and its radiations constantly glide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In looks of fair unconscious babes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or strangely in the coffin’d dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As some dissolving delicate film of dreams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hiding yet lingering.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Two little breaths of words comprising it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two words, yet all from first to last comprised in it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How ardently for it!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How many ships have sail’d and sunk for it!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How many travelers started from their homes and ne’er return’d!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How much of genius boldly staked and lost for it!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What countless stores of beauty, love, ventur’d for it!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How all superbest deeds since Time began are traceable to it⁠—and shall be to the end!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How all heroic martyrdoms to it!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How, justified by it, the horrors, evils, battles of the earth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it, in every age and land, have drawn men’s eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast, the sky, the islands, and the cliffs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or midnight’s silent glowing northern lights unreachable.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Haply God’s riddle it, so vague and yet so certain,</span>

				<p>
					<span>This is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou lovest best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Night, sleep, death and the stars.</span>
