					<p epub:type="bridgehead">Concluding <abbr>L.</abbr> of <abbr>G.</abbr>⁠—1891</p>
				</header>
				<p>Had I not better withhold (in this old age and paralysis of me) such little tags and fringe-dots (maybe specks, stains,) as follow a long dusty journey, and witness it afterward? I have probably not been enough afraid of careless touches, from the first⁠—and am not now⁠—nor of parrot-like repetitions⁠—nor platitudes and the commonplace. Perhaps I am too democratic for such avoidances. Besides, is not the verse-field, as originally plann’d by my theory, now sufficiently illustrated⁠—and full time for me to silently retire?⁠—(indeed amid no loud call or market for my sort of poetic utterance).</p>
				<p>In answer, or rather defiance, to that kind of well-put interrogation, here comes this little cluster, and conclusion of my preceding clusters. Though not at all clear that, as here collated, it is worth printing (certainly I have nothing fresh to write)⁠—I while away the hours of my 72nd year⁠—hours of forced confinement in my den⁠—by putting in shape this small old age collation:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Last droplets of and after spontaneous rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From many limpid distillations and past showers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Will they germinate anything? mere exhalations as they all are⁠—the land’s and sea’s⁠—America’s;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will they filter to any deep emotion? any heart and brain?)</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>However that may be, I feel like improving today’s opportunity and wind up. During the last two years I have sent out, in the lulls of illness and exhaustion, certain chirps⁠—lingering-dying ones probably (undoubtedly)⁠—which now I may as well gather and put in fair type while able to see correctly⁠—(for my eyes plainly warn me they are dimming, and my brain more and more palpably neglects or refuses, month after month, even slight tasks or revisions).</p>
				<p>In fact, here I am these current years 1890 and ’91, (each successive fortnight getting stiffer and stuck deeper) much like some hard-cased dilapidated grim ancient shellfish or time-bang’d conch (no legs, utterly non-locomotive) cast up high and dry on the shore-sands, helpless to move anywhere⁠—nothing left but behave myself quiet, and while away the days yet assign’d, and discover if there is anything for the said grim and time-bang’d conch to be got at last out of inherited good spirits and primal buoyant centre-pulses down there deep somewhere within his gray-blurr’d old shell.⁠ ⁠… (Reader, you must allow a little fun here⁠—for one reason there are too many of the following poemets about death, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and for another the passing hours (July 5, 1890) are so sunny-fine. And old as I am I feel today almost a part of some frolicsome wave, or for sporting yet like a kid or kitten⁠—probably a streak of physical adjustment and perfection here and now. I believe I have it in me perennially anyhow.)</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Then behind all, the deep-down consolation (it is a glum one, but I dare not be sorry for the fact of it in the past, nor refrain from dwelling, even vaunting here at the end) that this late-years palsied old shorn and shellfish condition of me is the indubitable outcome and growth, now near for 20 years along, of too overzealous, over-continued bodily and emotional excitement and action through the times of 1862, ’3, ’4 and ’5, visiting and waiting on wounded and sick army volunteers, both sides, in campaigns or contests, or after them, or in hospitals or fields south of Washington City, or in that place and elsewhere⁠—those hot, sad, wrenching times⁠—the army volunteers, all States⁠—or North or South⁠—the wounded, suffering, dying⁠—the exhausting, sweating summers, marches, battles, carnage⁠—those trenches hurriedly heap’d by the corpse-thousands, mainly unknown⁠—Will the America of the future⁠—will this vast rich Union ever realize what itself cost, back there after all?⁠—those hecatombs of battle-deaths⁠—Those times of which, O far-off reader, this whole book is indeed finally but a reminiscent memorial from thence by me to you?</p>

					<p epub:type="bridgehead">(When I was nearly grown to manhood in Brooklyn, New York (middle of 1838), I met one of the return’d <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.S.</abbr> Marines from Fort Moultrie, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">S.C.</abbr>, and had long talks with him⁠—learn’d the occurrence below described⁠—death of Osceola. The latter was a young, brave, leading Seminole in the Florida war of that time⁠—was surrender’d to our troops, imprison’d, and literally died of “a broken heart” at Fort Moultrie. He sicken’d of his confinement⁠—the doctor and officers made every allowance and kindness possible for him; then the close.)</p>

				<p>
					<span>When his hour for death had come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He slowly rais’d himself from the bed on the floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drew on his war-dress, shirt, leggings, and girdled the belt around his waist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Call’d for vermilion paint (his looking-glass was held before him,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Painted half his face and neck, his wrists, and back-hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put the scalp-knife carefully in his belt⁠—then lying down, resting a moment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose again, half sitting, smiled, gave in silence his extended hand to each and all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sank faintly low to the floor (tightly grasping the tomahawk handle,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fix’d his look on wife and little children⁠—the last:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(And here a line in memory of his name and death.)</span>

					<h3 epub:type="title">A Voice from Death</h3>
					<p epub:type="bridgehead">(The Johnstown, Penn., cataclysm, May 31, 1889)</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>A voice from Death, solemn and strange, in all his sweep and power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sudden, indescribable blow⁠—towns drown’d⁠—humanity by thousands slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The vaunted work of thrift, goods, dwellings, forge, street, iron bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dash’d pell-mell by the blow⁠—yet usher’d life continuing on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Amid the rest, amid the rushing, whirling, wild debris,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A suffering woman saved⁠—a baby safely born!)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Although I come and unannounc’d, in horror and in pang,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In pouring flood and fire, and wholesale elemental crash, (this voice so solemn, strange,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I too a minister of Deity.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yea, Death, we bow our faces, veil our eyes to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We mourn the old, the young untimely drawn to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fair, the strong, the good, the capable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The household wreck’d, the husband and the wife, the engulf’d forger in his forge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The corpses in the whelming waters and the mud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gather’d thousands to their funeral mounds, and thousands never found or gather’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then after burying, mourning the dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Faithful to them found or unfound, forgetting not, bearing the past, here new musing,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A day⁠—a passing moment or an hour⁠—America itself bends low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silent, resign’d, submissive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>War, death, cataclysm like this, America,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take deep to thy proud prosperous heart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>E’en as I chant, lo! out of death, and out of ooze and slime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blossoms rapidly blooming, sympathy, help, love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From West and East, from South and North and over sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its hot-spurr’d hearts and hands humanity to human aid moves on;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from within a thought and lesson yet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thou ever-darting Globe! through Space and Air!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou waters that encompass us!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou that in all the life and death of us, in action or in sleep!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou laws invisible that permeate them and all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou that in all, and over all, and through and under all, incessant!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou! thou! the vital, universal, giant force resistless, sleepless, calm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Holding Humanity as in thy open hand, as some ephemeral toy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How ill to e’er forget thee!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For I too have forgotten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Wrapt in these little potencies of progress, politics, culture, wealth, inventions, civilization,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have lost my recognition of your silent ever-swaying power, ye mighty, elemental throes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which and upon which we float, and every one of us is buoy’d.</span>
