				<p>
					<span>One’s-self I sing, a simple separate person,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of physiology from top to toe I sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I say the Form complete is worthier far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Female equally with the Male I sing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cheerful, for freest action form’d under the laws divine,</span>

					<span>The Modern Man I sing.</span>

				<p>
					<span>As I ponder’d in silence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Terrible in beauty, age, and power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The genius of poets of old lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to me directing like flame its eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With finger pointing to many immortal songs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And menacing voice, <q>What singest thou?</q> it said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Know’st thou not there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards?</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>The making of perfect soldiers.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span><q>Be it so,</q> then I answer’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>I too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Waged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance and retreat, victory deferr’d and wavering,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the field the world,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>For life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,</q>
					</span>

						<q>Lo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>I above all promote brave soldiers.</q>

					<span>In cabin’d ships at sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The boundless blue on every side expanding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or some lone bark buoy’d on the dense marine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under many a star at night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In full rapport at last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Here are our thoughts, voyagers’ thoughts,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span><q>Here not the land, firm land, alone appears,</q> may then by them be said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>The sky o’erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>We feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>The tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>The perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>The boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And this is ocean’s poem.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You not a reminiscence of the land alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos’d I know not whither, yet ever full of faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Consort to every ship that sails, sail you!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it here in every leaf;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the imperious waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chant on, sail on, bear o’er the boundless blue from me to every sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This song for mariners and all their ships.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Lo, I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And artillery-men, the deadliest that ever fired gun.</span>

					<span>Still though the one I sing,</span>

					<span>(One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to Nationality,</span>

					<span>Shut not your doors to me proud libraries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that which was lacking on all your well-fill’d shelves, yet needed most, I bring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth from the war emerging, a book I have made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The words of my book nothing, the drift of it everything,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A book separate, not link’d with the rest nor felt by the intellect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But you ye untold latencies will thrill to every page.</span>

					<span>Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than before known,</span>

					<span>Arouse! for you must justify me.</span>

					<span>I but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.</span>

				<p>
					<span>I am a man who, sauntering along without fully stopping, turns a casual look upon you and then averts his face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaving it to you to prove and define it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Expecting the main things from you.</span>
