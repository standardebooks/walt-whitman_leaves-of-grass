					<span>I celebrate myself, and sing myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what I assume you shall assume,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I loafe and invite my soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hoping to cease not till death.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Creeds and schools in abeyance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nature without check with original energy.</span>

					<span>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am mad for it to be in contact with me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The smoke of my own breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Echoes, ripples, buzz’d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color’d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sound of the belch’d words of my voice loos’d to the eddies of the wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Have you reckon’d a thousand acres much? have you reckon’d the earth much?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have you practis’d so long to learn to read?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.</span>

					<span>I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There was never any more inception than there is now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor any more youth or age than there is now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Urge and urge and urge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Always the procreant urge of the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I and this mystery here we stand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am satisfied⁠—I see, dance, laugh, sing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they turn from gazing after and down the road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?</span>

					<span>Trippers and askers surround me,</span>

					<span>Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,</span>

					<span>I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,</span>

					<span>And you must not be abased to the other.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that a kelson of the creation is love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>A child said <q>What is the grass?</q> fetching it to me with full hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say <q>Whose?</q></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Growing among black folks as among white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tenderly will I use you curling grass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And here you are the mothers’ laps.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Darker than the colorless beards of old men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What do you think has become of the young and old men?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what do you think has become of the women and children?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They are alive and well somewhere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ceas’d the moment life appear’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,</span>

					<span>And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.</span>

					<span>Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not contain’d between my hat and boots,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,</span>

					<span>Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;</span>

					<span>Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speeding with tail’d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,</span>

					<span>I tread day and night such roads.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,</span>

					<span>And look at quintillions ripen’d and look at quintillions green.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My course runs below the soundings of plummets.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I help myself to material and immaterial,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I anchor my ship for a little while only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I ascend to the foretruck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I take my place late at night in the crow’s-nest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They fetch my man’s body up dripping and drown’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I understand the large hearts of heroes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The courage of present times and all times,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chalk’d in large letters on a board, <q>Be of good cheer, we will not desert you;</q></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How he follow’d with them and tack’d with them three days and would not give it up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How he saved the drifting company at last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of their prepared graves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d unshaved men;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am the man, I suffer’d, I was there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The disdain and calmness of martyrs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mother of old, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover’d with sweat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the bullets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All these I feel or am.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn’d with the ooze of my skin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I fall on the weeds and stones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Agonies are one of my changes of garments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the wounded person,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They have clear’d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Distant and dead resuscitate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.</span>

				<p>
					<span>I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort’s bombardment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am there again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Again the long roll of the drummers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Again the attacking cannon, mortars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I take part, I see and hear the whole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim’d shots,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Retreating they had form’d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave up their arms and march’d back prisoners of war.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They were the glory of the race of rangers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not a single one over thirty years of age.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The work commenced about five o’clock and was over by eight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>None obey’d the command to kneel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some half-kill’d attempted to crawl away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These were despatch’d with bayonets or batter’d with the blunts of muskets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to release him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The three were all torn and cover’d with the boy’s blood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies;</span>

					<span>Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>List to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My captain lash’d fast with his own hands.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Our frigate takes fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other asks if we demand quarter?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If our colors are struck and the fighting done?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span><q>We have not struck,</q> he composedly cries, <q>we have just begun our part of the fighting.</q></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Only three guns are in use,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s main-mast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not a moment’s cease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Serene stands the little captain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The clock indicates the moment⁠—but what does eternity indicate?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Births have brought us richness and variety,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And other births will bring us richness and variety.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I do not call one greater and one smaller,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which fills its period and place is equal to any.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?</span>

					<br/>
					<span>On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All below duly travel’d, and still I mount and mount.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.</span>
				</p>

					<span>Long I was hugg’d close⁠—long and long.</span>

					<span>Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,</span>

					<span>Crying by day <q>Ahoy!</q> from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>We should surely bring up again where we now stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it impatient,</span>

					<span>This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And my spirit said <q>No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.</q></span>

				<p>
					<span>You are also asking me questions and I hear you,</span>

					<span>Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,</span>

					<span>The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No shutter’d room or school can commune with me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But roughs and little children better than they.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen and love them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The soldier camp’d or upon the march is mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My face rubs to the hunter’s face when he lies down alone in his blanket,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young mother and old mother comprehend me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They and all would resume what I have told them.</span>

					<span>I have said that the soul is not more than the body,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one’s self is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d universe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why should I wish to see God better than this day?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign’d by God’s name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe’er I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Others will punctually come forever and ever.</span>

					<span>And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not offend me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish’d breasts of melons.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O suns⁠—O grass of graves⁠—O perpetual transfers and promotions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you do not say anything how can I say anything?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toss, sparkles of day and dusk⁠—toss on the black stems that decay in the muck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wrench’d and sweaty⁠—calm and cool then my body becomes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I sleep⁠—I sleep long.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I do not know it⁠—it is without name⁠—it is a word unsaid,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,</span>

					<span>(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Do I contradict myself?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Very well then I contradict myself,</span>

					<span>(I am large, I contain multitudes.)</span>

				<p>
					<span>I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.</span>

					<span>The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.</span>

					<span>I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</span>

				<p>
					<span>The last scud of day holds back for me,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,</span>

					<span>You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,</span>
