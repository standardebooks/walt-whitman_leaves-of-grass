					<span>The log at the wood-pile, the axe supported by it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space clear’d for a garden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves after the storm is lull’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thought of ships struck in the storm and put on their beam ends, and the cutting away of masts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sentiment of the huge timbers of old-fashion’d houses and barns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The remember’d print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of men, families, goods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The disembarkation, the founding of a new city,</span>

					<span>The beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless impatience of restraint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The loose drift of character, the inkling through random types, the solidification;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The butcher in the slaughter-house, the hands aboard schooners and sloops, the raftsman, the pioneer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes of snow on the limbs of trees, the occasional snapping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glad clear sound of one’s own voice, the merry song, the natural life of the woods, the strong day’s work,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the bed of hemlock-boughs and the bear-skin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The house-builder at work in cities or anywhere,</span>

					<span>The hoist-up of beams, the push of them in their places, laying them regular,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises according as they were prepared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their curv’d limbs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on by posts and braces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hook’d arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe,</span>

					<span>Their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The huge storehouse carried up in the city well under way,</span>

					<span>The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands rapidly laying the long side-wall, two hundred feet from front to rear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the trowels striking the bricks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bricks one after another each laid so workmanlike in its place, and set with a knock of the trowel-handle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar-boards, and the steady replenishing by the hod-men;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spar-makers in the spar-yard, the swarming row of well-grown apprentices,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The swing of their axes on the square-hew’d log shaping it toward the shape of a mast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The butter-color’d chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk-heads, floats, stays against the sea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The city fireman, the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the close-pack’d square,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and daring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strong command through the fire-trumpets, the falling in line, the rise and fall of the arms forcing the water,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The crash and cut away of connecting wood-work, or through floors if the fire smoulders under them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The crowd with their lit faces watching, the glare and dense shadows;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The forger at his forge-furnace and the user of iron after him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel and trying the edge with his thumb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one who clean-shapes the handle and sets it firmly in the socket;</span>

					<span>The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The Roman lictors preceding the consuls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The antique European warrior with his axe in combat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The death-howl, the limpsy tumbling body, the rush of friend and foe thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The siege of revolted lieges determin’d for liberty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the truce and parley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sack of an old city in its time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in the gripe of brigands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Craft and thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons despairing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The list of all executive deeds and words just or unjust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The power of personality just or unjust.</span>

					<span>Or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or the best built steamships?</span>

					<span>The show passes, all does well enough of course,</span>

					<span>All does very well till one flash of defiance.</span>

					<span>The place where a great city stands is not the place of stretch’d wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits of produce merely,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops selling goods from the rest of the earth,</span>

					<span>Nor the place of the best libraries and schools, nor the place where money is plentiest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor the place of the most numerous population.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the city stands that is belov’d by these, and loves them in return and understands them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of elected persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the whistle of death pours its sweeping and unript waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside authority,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and President, Mayor, Governor and whatnot, are agents for pay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands,</span>
