					<span>(Ah little recks the laborer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How near his work is holding him to God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The loving Laborer through space and time.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>After all not to create only, or found only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to bring perhaps from afar what is already founded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give it our own identity, average, limitless, free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fill the gross the torpid bulk with vital religious fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not to repel or destroy so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To obey as well as command, to follow more than to lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These also are the lessons of our New World;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While how little the New after all, how much the Old, Old World!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long and long has the grass been growing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long and long has the rain been falling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long has the globe been rolling round.</span>

					<span>Come Muse migrate from Greece and Ionia,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cross out please those immensely overpaid accounts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That matter of Troy and Achilles’ wrath, and Aeneas’, Odysseus’ wanderings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Placard “Removed” and “To Let” on the rocks of your snowy Parnassus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Repeat at Jerusalem, place the notice high on Jaffa’s gate and on Mount Moriah,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same on the walls of your German, French and Spanish castles, and Italian collections,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For know a better, fresher, busier sphere, a wide, untried domain awaits, demands you.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Responsive to our summons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or rather to her long-nurs’d inclination,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Join’d with an irresistible, natural gravitation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She comes! I hear the rustling of her gown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I scent the odor of her breath’s delicious fragrance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mark her step divine, her curious eyes a-turning, rolling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this very scene.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The dame of dames! can I believe then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those ancient temples, sculptures classic, could none of them retain her?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor shades of Virgil and Dante, nor myriad memories, poems, old associations, magnetize and hold on to her?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that she’s left them all⁠—and here?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, if you will allow me to say so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, my friends, if you do not, can plainly see her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same undying soul of earth’s, activity’s, beauty’s, heroism’s expression,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out from her evolutions hither come, ended the strata of her former themes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hidden and cover’d by to-day’s, foundation of to-day’s,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ended, deceas’d through time, her voice by Castaly’s fountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silent the broken-lipp’d Sphynx in Egypt, silent all those century-baffling tombs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ended for aye the epics of Asia’s, Europe’s helmeted warriors, ended the primitive call of the muses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Calliope’s call forever closed, Clio, Melpomene, Thalia dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana, ended the quest of the Holy Graal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind, extinct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Crusaders’ streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the sunrise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amadis, Tancred, utterly gone, Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Palmerin, ogre, departed, vanish’d the turrets that Usk from its waters reflected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arthur vanish’d with all his knights, Merlin and Lancelot and Galahad, all gone, dissolv’d utterly like an exhalation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pass’d! pass’d! for us, forever pass’d, that once so mighty world, now void, inanimate, phantom world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Embroider’d, dazzling, foreign world, with all its gorgeous legends, myths,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its kings and castles proud, its priests and warlike lords and courtly dames,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pass’d to its charnel vault, coffin’d with crown and armor on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blazon’d with Shakespeare’s purple page,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dirged by Tennyson’s sweet sad rhyme.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I say I see, my friends, if you do not, the illustrious émigré, (having it is true in her day, although the same, changed, journey’d considerable,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Making directly for this rendezvous, vigorously clearing a path for herself, striding through the confusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By thud of machinery and shrill steam-whistle undismay’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bluff’d not a bit by drain-pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smiling and pleas’d with palpable intent to stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She’s here, install’d amid the kitchen ware!</span>

					<span>To introduce the stranger, (what else indeed do I live to chant for?) to thee Columbia;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In liberty’s name welcome immortal! clasp hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever henceforth sisters dear be both.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fear not O Muse! truly new ways and days receive, surround you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I candidly confess a queer, queer race, of novel fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet the same old human race, the same within, without,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faces and hearts the same, feelings the same, yearnings the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same old love, beauty and use the same.</span>

					<span>We do not blame thee elder World, nor really separate ourselves from thee,</span>

					<span>(Would the son separate himself from the father?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Looking back on thee, seeing thee to thy duties, grandeurs, through past ages bending, building,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We build to ours to-day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Mightier than Egypt’s tombs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fairer than Grecia’s, Roma’s temples,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prouder than Milan’s statued, spired cathedral,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More picturesque than Rhenish castle-keeps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We plan even now to raise, beyond them all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy great cathedral sacred industry, no tomb,</span>

					<span>Its manifold ensemble.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Around a palace, loftier, fairer, ampler than any yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earth’s modern wonder, history’s seven outstripping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High rising tier on tier with glass and iron façades,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gladdening the sun and sky, enhued in cheerfulest hues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bronze, lilac, robin’s-egg, marine and crimson,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over whose golden roof shall flaunt, beneath thy banner Freedom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The banners of the States and flags of every land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A brood of lofty, fair, but lesser palaces shall cluster.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Somewhere within their walls shall all that forwards perfect human life be started,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tried, taught, advanced, visibly exhibited.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not only all the world of works, trade, products,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all the workmen of the world here to be represented.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here shall you trace in flowing operation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every state of practical, busy movement, the rills of civilization,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Materials here under your eye shall change their shape as if by magic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cotton shall be pick’d almost in the very field,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall be dried, clean’d, ginn’d, baled, spun into thread and cloth before you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall see hands at work at all the old processes and all the new ones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall see the various grains and how flour is made and then bread baked by the bakers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall see the crude ores of California and Nevada passing on and on till they become bullion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall watch how the printer sets type, and learn what a composing-stick is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall mark in amazement the Hoe press whirling its cylinders, shedding the printed leaves steady and fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The photograph, model, watch, pin, nail, shall be created before you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In large calm halls, a stately museum shall teach you the infinite lessons of minerals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In another, woods, plants, vegetation shall be illustrated⁠—in another animals, animal life and development.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One stately house shall be the music house,</span>

					<span>That hell unpent and raid of blood, fit for wild tigers or for lop-tongued wolves, not reasoning men,</span>

					<span>I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for art,</span>

					<span>To exalt the present and the real,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sing in songs how exercise and chemical life are never to be baffled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To manual work for each and all, to plough, hoe, dig,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To plant and tend the tree, the berry, vegetables, flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For every man to see to it that he really do something, for every woman too;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To use the hammer and the saw, (rip, or cross-cut,)</span>

					<span>To cultivate a turn for carpentering, plastering, painting,</span>

					<span>To work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To invent a little, something ingenious, to aid the washing, cooking, cleaning,</span>
