				<p>
					<span>Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Healthy, free, the world before me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strong and content I travel the open road.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The earth, that is sufficient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not want the constellations any nearer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know they are very well where they are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know they suffice for those who belong to them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am fill’d with them, and I will fill them in return.)</span>

					<span>You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all that is here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I believe that much unseen is also here.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas’d, the illiterate person, are not denied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar’s tramp, the drunkard’s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The escaped youth, the rich person’s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the town, the return back from the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They pass, I also pass, anything passes, none can be interdicted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.</span>

					<span>You air that serves me with breath to speak!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You flagg’d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides! you distant ships!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You rows of houses! you window-pierc’d façades! you roofs!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You doors and ascending steps! you arches!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From all that has touch’d you I believe you have imparted to yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.</span>

					<span>The earth expanding right hand and left hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The picture alive, every part in its best light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is not wanted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O highway I travel, do you say to me <q>Do not leave me</q>?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you say <q>Venture not⁠—if you leave me you are lost</q>?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you say <q>I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and undenied, adhere to me</q>?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You express me better than I can express myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall be more to me than my poem.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I think heroic deeds were all conceiv’d in the open air, and all free poems also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever beholds me shall like me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think whoever I see must be happy.</span>

					<span>From this hour I ordain myself loos’d of limits and imaginary lines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Listening to others, considering well what they say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I inhale great draughts of space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am larger, better than I thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not know I held so much goodness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All seems beautiful to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me I would do the same to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will recruit for myself and you as I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will scatter myself among men and women as I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear’d it would not astonish me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here a great personal deed has room,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here is the test of wisdom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom is not finally tested in schools,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom cannot be pass’d from one having it to another not having it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the excellence of things;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I re-examine philosophies and religions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here is realization,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here is a man tallied⁠—he realizes here what he has in him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The past, the future, majesty, love⁠—if they are vacant of you, you are vacant of them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Only the kernel of every object nourishes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion’d, it is apropos;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?</span>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal">7</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Here is the efflux of the soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower’d gates, ever provoking questions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as I pass;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by and pause?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What gives me to be free to a woman’s and man’s good-will? what gives them to be free to mine?</span>
				</p>

			<section id="song-of-the-open-road-8" epub:type="part">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal">8</h3>
				<p>
					<span>The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here rises the fluid and attaching character,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From it falls distill’d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.</span>
