			<section id="song-of-the-redwood-tree-1" epub:type="part">

				<p>
					<span>A California song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A prophecy and indirection, a thought impalpable to breathe as air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads departing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Farewell my brethren,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>My time has ended, my term has come.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Along the northern coast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just back from the rock-bound shore and the caves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the redwood forest dense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard the mighty tree its death-chant chanting.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The quick-ear’d teamsters and chain and jack-screw men heard not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to join the refrain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in my soul I plainly heard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its foot-thick bark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past only but the future.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>You untold life of me,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And all you venerable and innocent joys,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Perennial hardy life of me with joys ’mid rain and many a summer sun,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And the white snows and night and the wild winds;</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>O the great patient rugged joys, my soul’s strong joys unreck’d by man,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>(For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have consciousness, identity,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Our time, our term has come.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>We who have grandly fill’d our time;</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>With Nature’s calm content, with tacit huge delight,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>We welcome what we wrought for through the past,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And leave the field for them.</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>For them predicted long,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>For a superber race, they too to grandly fill their time,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>For them we abdicate, in them ourselves ye forest kings!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>In them these skies and airs, these mountain peaks, Shasta, Nevadas,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>These huge precipitous cliffs, this amplitude, these valleys, far Yosemite,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>To be in them absorb’d, assimilated.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then to a loftier strain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if the heirs, the deities of the West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joining with master-tongue bore part.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Not wan from Asia’s fetishes,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Nor red from Europe’s old dynastic slaughter-house,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>(Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and scaffolds everywhere,)</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>But come from Nature’s long and harmless throes, peacefully builded thence,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>These virgin lands, lands of the Western shore,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>To the new culminating man, to you, the empire new,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You promis’d long, we pledge, we dedicate.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>You occult deep volitions,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You average spiritual manhood, purpose of all, pois’d on yourself, giving not taking law,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence life and love and aught that comes from life and love,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of America, (age upon age working in death the same as life,)</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and mould the New World, adjusting it to Time and Space,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You hidden national will lying in your abysms, conceal’d but ever alert,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued, may-be unconscious of yourselves,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Unswerv’d by all the passing errors, perturbations of the surface;</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds, arts, statutes, literatures,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here build your homes for good, establish here, these areas entire, lands of the Western shore,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>We pledge, we dedicate to you.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>For man of you, your characteristic race,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here may he hardy, sweet, gigantic grow, here tower proportionate to Nature,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined, uncheck’d by wall or roof,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here laugh with storm or sun, here joy, here patiently inure,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here heed himself, unfold himself, (not others’ formulas heed,) here fill his time,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>To duly fall, to aid, unreck’d at last,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>To disappear, to serve.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus on the northern coast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the echo of teamsters’ calls and the clinking chains, and the music of choppers’ axes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the groan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such words combined from the redwood-tree, as of voices ecstatic, ancient and rustling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the Cascade range to the Wahsatch, or Idaho far, or Utah,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity, the settlements, features all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the Mendocino woods I caught.</span>

				<p>
					<span>The flashing and golden pageant of California,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sudden and gorgeous drama, the sunny and ample lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado south,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air, valleys and mountain cliffs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow, the silent, cyclic chemistry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The slow and steady ages plodding, the unoccupied surface ripening, the rich ores forming beneath;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At last the New arriving, assuming, taking possession,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ships coming in from the whole round world, and going out to the whole world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To India and China and Australia and the thousand island paradises of the Pacific,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Populous cities, the latest inventions, the steamers on the rivers, the railroads, with many a thrifty farm, with machinery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wool and wheat and the grape, and diggings of yellow gold.</span>

				<p>
					<span>But more in you than these, lands of the Western shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(These but the means, the implements, the standing-ground,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of years, till now deferr’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Promis’d to be fulfill’d, our common kind, the race.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The new society at last, proportionate to Nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In man of you, more than your mountain peaks or stalwart trees imperial,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In woman more, far more, than all your gold or vines, or even vital air.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fresh come, to a new world indeed, yet long prepared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the genius of the modern, child of the real and ideal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearing the ground for broad humanity, the true America, heir of the past so grand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To build a grander future.</span>
