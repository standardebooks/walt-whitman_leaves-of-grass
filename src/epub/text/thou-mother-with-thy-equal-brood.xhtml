						<span>Thou Mother with thy equal brood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou varied chain of different States, yet one identity only,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A special song before I go I’d sing o’er all the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For thee, the future.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I’d sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’d fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’d show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be accomplish’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The paths to the house I seek to make,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But leave to those to come the house itself.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Belief I sing, and preparation;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But greater still from what is yet to come,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of that formula for thee I sing.</span>

					<p>
						<span>As a strong bird on pinions free,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such be the thought I’d think of thee America,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such be the recitative I’d bring for thee.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The conceits of the poets of other lands I’d bring thee not,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or indoor library;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But an odor I’d bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or breath of an Illinois prairie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from Texas uplands, or Florida’s glades,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or the Saguenay’s black stream, or the wide blue spread of Huron,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With presentment of Yellowstone’s scenes, or Yosemite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And murmuring under, pervading all, I’d bring the rustling sea-sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mind-formulas fitted for thee, real and sane and large as these and thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou! mounting higher, diving deeper than we knew, thou transcendental Union!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By thee fact to be justified, blended with thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thought of man justified, blended with God,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through thy reality, lo, the immortal idea!</span>

						<span>Brain of the New World, what a task is thine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To formulate the Modern⁠—out of the peerless grandeur of the modern,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches, art,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Recast, maybe discard them, end them⁠—may-be their work is done, who knows?)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the mighty past, the dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old World brain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou carefully prepared by it so long⁠—haply thou but unfoldest it, only maturest it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It to eventuate in thee⁠—the essence of the by-gone time contain’d in thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined with reference to thee;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou but the apples, long, long, long a-growing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fruit of all the Old ripening to-day in thee.</span>

						<span>Of value is thy freight, ’tis not the Present only,</span>

						<span>The Past is also stored in thee,</span>

						<span>Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like a limitless golden cloud filling the western sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Emblem of general maternity lifted above all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless procession issuing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Acceding from such gestation, taking and giving continual strength and life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>World of the real⁠—world of the twain in one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>World of the soul, born by the world of the real alone, led to identity, body, by it alone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet in beginning only, incalculable masses of composite precious materials,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By history’s cycles forwarded, by every nation, language, hither sent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ready, collected here, a freer, vast, electric world, to be constructed here,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(The true New World, the world of orbic science, morals, literatures to come,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou wonder world yet undefined, unform’d, neither do I define thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I feel thy ominous greatness evil as well as good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I watch thee advancing, absorbing the present, transcending the past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see thy light lighting, and thy shadow shadowing, as if the entire globe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly to comprehend thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I but thee name, thee prophesy, as now,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I merely thee ejaculate!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thee in thy future,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee in thy only permanent life, career, thy own unloosen’d mind, thy soaring spirit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee as another equally needed sun, radiant, ablaze, swift-moving, fructifying all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and joy, in endless great hilarity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long, that weigh’d so long upon the mind of man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain decadence of man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee in thy larger, saner brood of female, male⁠—thee in thy athletes, moral, spiritual, South, North, West, East,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(To thy immortal breasts, Mother of All, thy every daughter, son, endear’d alike, forever equal,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee in thy own musicians, singers, artists, unborn yet, but certain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization, (until which thy proudest material civilization must remain in vain,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee in thy all-supplying, all-enclosing worship⁠—thee in no single bible, saviour, merely,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy saviours countless, latent within thyself, thy bibles incessant within thyself, equal to any, divine as any,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Thy soaring course thee formulating, not in thy two great wars, nor in thy century’s visible growth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But far more in these leaves and chants, thy chants, great Mother!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee in an education grown of thee, in teachers, studies, students, born of thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee in thy democratic fêtes en-masse, thy high original festivals, operas, lecturers, preachers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee in thy ultimata, (the preparations only now completed, the edifice on sure foundations tied,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee in thy pinnacles, intellect, thought, thy topmost rational joys, thy love and godlike aspiration,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In thy resplendent coming literati, thy full-lung’d orators, thy sacerdotal bards, kosmic savans,</span>

						<span>These! these in thee, (certain to come,) to-day I prophesy.</span>
